\section{Motivation}
To me it is now clear that Computer Science is the science of \textbf{automating things}
by creating \textbf{artificial intelligence}. 
Hence, sadly, it is also the science of putting people out of jobs. As an example,
consider Amazon, the so-called "Tech Giant" which hires hundreds if not thousands 
of software engineers every year.
